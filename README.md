# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

_Is the making of applications/softwares systematically, whilst applying engineering pinciples to the design, development, and maintanance and focusing on creating reliable, efficient, and scalable solutions and ensuring high quality and maintainability._
_Software engineering can be used to create applications that can be used in businesses eg; Point-of-sale sys, in healthcare to monitor and drive the healt mach. finance eg in banks, education and in entertainment._
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

_Birth of s/w engineering: (1968) - The term was formally introduced at the NATO S/w eng. conference to address s/w dev. changes._
_Agile Manifesto: (2001) - Introduced flexible and iterative development processes, improving responsiveness to change._
_DevOps and CI/CD: (2010's to present) - The intergration of development and operations with automation to speed up the development process. (Continuous Inergration & COntinuous Delivery.)_

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

   1. Requirement Analysis - Gathering and defining sys. requirements.
   2. Planing - Defining scope, timelines, and resources.
   3. Design - Creating s/w arch. and user interface designs.
   4. Implementation - Writind. developing the actual s/w (coding).
   5. Testing - Verifying functionality, security, and performance.
   6. Deployment - Releasing the s/w to the end-users for use.
   7. Maintenance - Ongoing updates and fixing bugs.

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

_Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next one begins while Agile methodology is an iterative approach with continuous feedback and incremental releases.
Waterfall - eg: best for projects with well-defined requirements like government contracts.
Agile - eg: best for dynamic environments like s/w startups._ 

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

_1. Software developer - writes & maintains code, implements features, and collaborates with the team._
_2. Q/A Eng. - Tests s/w for defects, ensures functionality, and maintains quality standards._
_3. Project manager - oversees timelines, resources, and ensures project goals align with business objectives._

6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

_IDE - enhance productivity by offering debugging, syntax highlighting, and code completion. eg: Visual Studio Code.
Version Ctrl Sys - Platforms like Git/Github enable collaboration, track changes, and support team-based development._

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

_1. Scope creep - Clearly define project requirements and use Agile for flexibility.
 2. Technical Debt - Maintain code quality and refactor code regularly.
 3. Security vulnerability - Implement secure coding practices and regular security audits._

8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

_1. Unit testing - testing individual components.
 2. Intergration testing - verifying interactions between modules.
 3. System testing - Ensuring the system is meeting the requirements.
 4. Acceptance testing - Confirming the software is satisfying the user needs._

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

_Prompt engineering involves crafting effective inputs to guide AI models in generating accurate and useful responses, essential for optimizing AI interactions and improving output relevance._

2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

_1. Vague prompt : Tell me about history.
 2. Improved prompt : Provide a summary of the major events of WW1, focusing on key attles & their impact.
 3. Effectiveness : The improved prompt is effective, provides clear context and expected output._
